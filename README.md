## Public Goods Game with Real-Effort Transcription
This game is a modified public goods game where playersâ€™ initial income is determined by their accuracy in transcribing an image of distorted text. Each player must then decide how much of their income to contribute to a public pot before its contents are multiplied by a factor and redistributed to all participants.

## How to Run the Game 
1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree, which contains the core files necessary to run experiments that are written using the oTree Python framework, into a folder on your local machine.
2. Naviate to the "oTree" directory. 
3. Remove the existing real_effort directory by executing the command  "rm -rf -- real_effort".
4. Clone this real_effort repository into the oTree folder.
6. Run the command "pip3 install -U otree" in terminal.
7. Run the command "pip3 install Pillow" in terminal.
8. Modify the settings.py file and add a dictionary entry in the SESSION_CONFIGS list such that the necessary name, display_name, num_demo_participants, and app_sequence keys are included. The value for the 'name' key must be the exact name of the experiment repository, which is in this case 'real_effort'. An example is shown below:
   
   {'name': 'real_effort', 'display_name': "Public Goods With Transcription", 'num_demo_participants': 4, 'app_sequence': ['real_effort']}
9. Ensure that you're in the oTree folder. Then, type "otree devserver" into the terminal.
10. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/demo/ in your browser.
11. Click on the appropriate experiment based on what you specified this game's display name to be.
12. Click on the session-wide link to begin playing the game.
