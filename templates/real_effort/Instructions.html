        This game combines elements of the Public Goods game and Real Effort
        Transcription task into one activity. In this game, there are two modes: no transcription
        and transcription, both of which are described as follows:

        <br><br>
        <b>Mode 1 (No Transcription):</b>
        This is the Public Goods game modified slightly. You will be in a randomly formed
        group of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants, where each participant is given a fixed income, and a
        tax of X% is automatically collected. You must decide how much of your income you will report. Reported income
        could be any integer from 0 to your base income.
        <br><br>
        <b>Mode 2 (Transcription):</b>
        You do not start with a fixed income. Rather, you are shown two images of incomprehensible text and are required
        to transcribe (copy) the text into a text entry field. The quality of a subject's transcription is measured by
        the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a>.
        The accuracy of each players' transcription of the second image ultimately determines
        each person's income. The remainder of mode 2 follows mode 1.
    </p>

        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The
        tax collected from each of the {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants
        is added up and multiplied by a certain factor, and the resulting amount is the
        total earnings from the project, which is evenly split among all
        {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. Each participant's payoff equals the
        their share of the tax money plus the amount of income they had remaining after tax
        was deducted.
